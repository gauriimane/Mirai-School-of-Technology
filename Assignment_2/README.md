# 🌌 AI Multiverse

**AI Multiverse** is an interactive Streamlit application that lets users chat with multiple AI personalities powered by **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**. Each AI Universe has its own unique personality, greeting, conversation history, and communication style, providing a fun and immersive conversational experience.

Built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, **Google Generative AI**, and **python-dotenv**, this project demonstrates how prompt engineering can be used to create distinct AI personalities while maintaining separate chat sessions for each universe.
